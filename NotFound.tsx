Incase you have images in your article (Highly reccomended), you have to “link” the image in your pdf. So basically instead of just uploading he image in your pdf, you upload the link of the image, and make sure the link of the image is hosted in a reliable source. Such as Wikipedia, Freepik, Pixabay, Pexels, Unsplash, X, Freeimages, Shutterstock, etc. This process is not recommended at all, but we accept it."
